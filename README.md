Grasshopper
===========

*Editor's note*: This package was README-ware and has not seen development since
2014. Please go to [loopr](https://github.com/kirillseva/loopr) for the latest
on hyperparameter optimization. In particular, best practices in the industry
now focus on Gaussian processes.

Grasshopper is an R framework for testing questions about classifiers
coming from learning theory: convergence rate, estimation of
empirical risk minimization potential, etc.
